# Cyquest
Cyquest is an online hunt app. Still in the development phase. The whole project runs on Django.
- A user registers himself up. Then only can he take part in the online hunt.
- There is a superuser account. Only the superuser can grant or revoke other admin rights.
- There is a page for setting up questions. Only admins have that right.

# Requirement
Any system with python 3 (preferably 3.6) and terminal.

# Usage
- Navigate to the cloned repository.
- Run python manage.py runserver

# Working On
Currently trying to setup a dashboard, a leaderboard, and trying to improve the question setting interface.

# Known Issue
None as of now. Feel free to open an issue if any!
