# Cyquest
Cyquest is an online hunt app. Still in the development phase. The whole project runs on Django.
- A user registers himself up. Then only can he take part in the online hunt.
- There is a superuser account. Only the superuser can grant or revoke other admin rights.
- There is a page for setting up questions. Only admins have that right.
- Once, the questions are set, a user can play the game, see the leaderboard and stuff.
